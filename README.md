# Improving_Face_recognition_Performance_using_Triplet_Loss
This is one of the model in our project:  
EFM model with Triplet loss  

1. extract_feacture_v2.py -> feature extraction
2. pre-trained_efm_v3.py -> using pre-trained edm model to optimize the similarity with Triplet loss
3. draw_cos_dis_real.py -> draw the figure of cosine similarity
